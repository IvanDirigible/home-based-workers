OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 4 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb to get the data for all states. It helped me with providing me this code: geo={"for": "state:*"} to use. It also helped me with how to convert the list of lists to a DataFrame with this code: “wfh_df = pd.DataFrame(data[1:], columns=data[0])”. I learned to use the map function names_state dictionary and replaces the FIPS code with the corresponding state name. I also learned to use pd.concat to help me combine multiple DataFrames vertically (i.e., stacking them on top of each other). I also used the parameter “ignore_index=True” to help ignoring the existing row/index labels and generate a new index instead. I also learned from this website to use astype(int) to convert the values in my columns to intergers so I can calculate them to percentages. The website also helped provide this method to me: .apply(lambda x: "{:.2f}%".format(x)) so that I can format the percentage columns to two decimal places and put a % symbol in there.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 5 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb to change the percentage column to numeric values. It helped provide this function for me to do that change: "apply(lambda x: float(x.replace('%', '').replace(',', '')) if isinstance(x, str) else x". It taught me to use the methods above to remove any % and commas. It then checks if it’s a string and if not, it converts it to a float (numeric value). I learned to use the pivot method in this part of the code: "wfh_percentage_df = mean_df.pivot(index='State', columns='Year', values='Percentage of Workers Who Work From Home')" which helped me reshape the data. It transformed the data from a state-year combination to a separate state and separate year column. Retrieved from https://chat.openai.com/chat

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 6 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb to help me with figuring out how to remove the % and comma in my values using the .replace method. It helped me create a stacked bar chart: “ax = wfh_percentage_df.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(14, 8), width=0.9)”. I learned to use stacked = True to get the stacked bar chart and width to change the spacing between each percentage bars. I also learned to use the ha=right parameter when using the xticks function to make sure my x-axis labels are aligned to the right. Retrieved from https://chat.openai.com/chat

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 8 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb to help me with figuring out how to create a separate bar chart for each year. I used the index function to help retrieve the state names in the index. I also used this function: “indices = np.arange(len(year_data)) “ to help with generating positions for each state.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 11 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb with processing the data into a structured format. I used the .get(...'Unknown') and .get(...'None') method to help me with getting the values from the variables and returns either Unknown if they cannot locate the value or None if they cannot locate the value.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 12 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb. I used this code from it: "to_numeric(....errors = 'coerce')". This helped me convert my column into numeric values and replace values that cannot be converted to a number to NaN. I used the pivot_table method to group and summarize the data, and the aggfunc parameter to find the average value for the 'Percentage Worked From Home' column for each state, year, and gender combination.I used this if statement from the website: "if pd.notnull(x) else None" checks whether the value x isis not NaN or None. If the value is not null, the function will format it as a percentage. If the value is null, it returns None instead of trying to format the value, which prevents errors when trying to apply the formatting to missing data. I used this code: gender_percentage_df.columns = [f"{year} {gender} Percentage Worked From Home" for year, gender in gender_percentage_df.columns] to help me make each column name is a single string that contains both the year and the gender to read the data easier.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 14 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb with looping the earning category and getting the value. I learned to use the items function for this part of the code: "for category, code in earnings_codes.items()". I alos used this code: “#earnings_columns = list(earnings_codes.keys()) for col in earnings_columns: earnings_df[col] = pd.to_numeric(earnings_df[col], errors='coerce')”. I was not sure how to convert the values to numeric for each column. I learned to use .keys() to return all the keys from earnings_codes dictionary. I also learned how to use the for in condition to loop through the data and convert them to numeric. Retrieved from https://chat.openai.com/chat

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 16 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb. I learned how to use this code: “final_percentage_2020_df.columns = final_percentage_2020_df.columns.str.replace(r'[^A-Za-z0-9]', '')” to remove commas, spaces, and any special characters in the column names. I learned how to define the categories so that I can use them to plot a stacked bar graph. I learned to use this code: final_percentage_2020_df[categories] = final_percentage_2020_df[categories].replace({'%': '', ',': ''}).astype(float)” which helped me with how to remove the %, commas, and convert the values to float.
