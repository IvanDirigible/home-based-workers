OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 4 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb to get the data for all states. It helped me with providing me this code: geo={"for": "state:*"} to use. It also helped me with how to convert the list of lists to a DataFrame with this code: “wfh_df = pd.DataFrame(data[1:], columns=data[0])”. I learned to use the map function names_state dictionary and replaces the FIPS code with the corresponding state name. I also learned to use pd.concat to help me combine multiple DataFrames vertically (i.e., stacking them on top of each other). I also used the parameter “ignore_index=True” to help ignoring the existing row/index labels and generate a new index instead. I also learned from this website to use astype(int) to convert the values in my columns to intergers so I can calculate them to percentages. The website also helped provide this method to me: .apply(lambda x: "{:.2f}%".format(x)) so that I can format the percentage columns to two decimal places and put a % symbol in there.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 5 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb to change the percentage column to numeric values and remove any % and commas. It helped provide this function for me to do those changes: "apply(lambda x: float(x.replace('%', '').replace(',', '')) if isinstance(x, str) else x". I learned to use the pivot method in this part of the code: "wfh_percentage_df = mean_df.pivot(index='State', columns='Year', values='Percentage of Workers Who Work From Home')" which helped me reshape the data. It transformed the data from a state-year combination to a separate state and separate year column. I also learned to rename the columns with this function: "#wfh_percentage_df.columns = [f"Percentage of Workers Who Work From Home ({year})" for year in wfh_percentage_df.columns]". This function helped me to label the columns to be the "Percentage of Workers Who Work From Home" for different years. It also provided this function for me: ".map(lambda x: f"{x:.2f}%" if isinstance(x, (float, int)) else x)". This function taught me to use the lambda function to every element in wfh_percentage_df. If the element is a number (either a float or int), it will be formatted as a percentage with two decimal places. Retrieved from https://chat.openai.com/chat

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 6 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb. It helped me to identify only the columns that contain the percentages (for each year) by providing me this function: "percentage_columns = [col for col in wfh_percentage_df_numeric.columns if 'Percentage of Workers Who Work From Home' in col]". and it helped me sort the DataFrame by those percentage columns by providing me this function: "wfh_percentage_df_sorted = wfh_percentage_df_numeric.sort_values(by=percentage_columns, ascending=False)".

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 8 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb. It provided me this function: "wfh_percentage_df_2020 = wfh_df[wfh_df['Year'] == 2020].set_index('State')" which helped me create a new DataFrame wfh_percentage_df_2020 that contains only the rows from the original DataFrame wfh_df where the 'Year' is 2020, with 'State' now serving as the index. It also provided me this function: "ax = wfh_percentage_df_2020['Percentage of Workers Who Work From Home'].plot(kind='bar', figsize=(14, 8))" which helped me to create a bar chart and specify the size of the bar chart.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 12 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb with processing the data into a structured format. I used the .get(...'Unknown') and .get(...'None') method to help me with getting the values from the variables and returns either Unknown if they cannot locate the value or None if they cannot locate the value.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 13 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb. I used this code from it: "to_numeric(....errors = 'coerce')". This helped me convert my column into numeric values and replace values that cannot be converted to a number to NaN. I used the pivot_table method to group and summarize the data, and the aggfunc parameter to find the average value for the 'Percentage Worked From Home' column for each state, year, and gender combination.I used this if statement from the website: "if pd.notnull(x) else None" checks whether the value x is NaN or None. If the value is not null, the function will format it as a percentage. If the value is null, it returns None instead of trying to format the value, which prevents errors when trying to apply the formatting to missing data. I used this code: gender_percentage_df.columns = [f"{year} {gender} Percentage Worked From Home" for year, gender in gender_percentage_df.columns] to help me make each column name is a single string that contains both the year and the gender to read the data easier.

OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. Accessed on Nov 2024. I, Mai Houa Hang, used this website for help with step 15 on the Census_ACS_Data.ipynb with looping the earning category and getting the value. I learned to use the items function for this part of the code: "for category, code in earnings_codes.items()". I had trouble trying to convert my data to numeric values. It helped provide me these functions: "earnings_columns = list(earnings_codes.keys()) for col in earnings_columns: earnings_df[col] = pd.to_numeric(earnings_df[col], errors='coerce')". These functions helped me to extract the column names from the earnings_code dictionary and stores them in a list. Then it loops through each column name in the earnings-column list. It then converts the values in each column of the DataFrame to numeric values. This part of the function "errors='coerce'" helped me to replace NaN for any non-numeric values so I won't get any errors running the code. Retrieved from https://chat.openai.com/chat
